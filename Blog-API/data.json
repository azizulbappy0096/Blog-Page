    "content": "According to a recent U.K. survey, bloggers have ranked as the third most trustworthy source of information, following only friends and family. That's right -- bloggers are trusted more than celebrities, journalists, brands, and politicians.\n\nBut how do you get people to fall in love with your blog in the first place? (Aside from remarkable content, of course.)\nWell, just as your website homepage is like the front door to your business, your blog's design -- much like a welcome mat -- is the front door to your business blog.\n\nIf you're not attracting people visually, how will you get them to take the next steps to actually read (and, hopefully, subscribe to) your content? Once you're done creating the quality content, you still have the challenge of presenting it in a way that clearly dictates what your blog is about. Images, text, and links need to be shown off just right -- otherwise, readers might abandon your content, if it's not showcased in a way that's appealing, easy to follow, and generates more interest.\n\nThat's why we've compiled some examples of blog homepages to get you on the right track to designing the perfect blog for your readers. Check 'em out, below.",
